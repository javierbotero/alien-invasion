The game starts with a fleet of aliens and a
rocket that can be move left and right
with the arrow keys, and fires bullets
with the space bar. When all aliens are destroyed,
another new and faster fleet will appear.
If one of the aliens reaches the bottom of the screen,
or touches the rocket the player loses one ship.
If all ships are destroyed, the game is over.
